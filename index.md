#Avi Glozman

This website contains a variety of information about myself, *Avi Glozman*.
This includes posts about:

- biographical information,
- poetry,
- projects,
- opinions on various topics,

etc.

##Note:
...
I decided to change the format of my website to something more readable, and
easier to navigate. I totally get tbhat CSS and JS are useful for making stuff
look pretty, but I find it useless considering I'm not a designer whose goal is
to showcase their skill.

The previous iteration of this website was designed by my friend [Owen Cheung] (https://github.com/owenhcheung)
, who did a great job. This website can be found [here] (https://github.com/avigloz/website/).
