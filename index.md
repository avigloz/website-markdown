**Welcome.** This is my personal site, where you can find various information about me.
I may also add long-form posts about topics I find interesting.

I'm a **CS major**, at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh), graduating in 2021.

<hr align="left" width="50%">

Here's my [GitHub](https://github.com/avigloz).

Here's my [site](https://pitt.edu/~abg41)* on the University of Pittsburgh domain.

(*: This site's design is based on it, but the content is different.)

My rates for online tutoring are flat for *everyone*.

However, if you are a student at the **University of Pittsburgh**, I can also do

Additionally, I give **University of Pittsburgh** students *only* a flat discount of -$10/hr.

  At Pitt, I am comfortable with material up to **CS 0445** (as of right now.)
