# Tutoring
[\[Home\]](../) [\[About me\]](../about.html)

I currently offer tutoring services in various subjects. I do most of my tutoring
online (over Skype), though I have done in-person tutoring in the past on
numerous occasions.

I have taken various math courses (up to Calculus 3), as well as several
Computer Science related courses. I also work on various programming projects
during much of my spare time. **I'm also an incoming Freshman at the
University of Pittsburgh as a Computer Science major.**

My email can be found [here](../about.html#contact).

## Subjects
* * *
I tutor various subjects, though in most cases I tutor STEM-related subjects.

### Science
- Biology (middle school, high school, and college-level introductory)
- Physics (middle school, high school, and college-level introductory)

### Math
- Elementary math (grades K-5, including *Arithmetic*, *Fractions*, etc.)
- Middle school math (grades 6-8, including *Pre-Algebra*, *Algebra 1*, *Geometry*)
- High school/college-level math (grades 9-12, including *Algebra 2*, *Pre-Calculus/Trigonometry*, *Calculus*)

### Computer Science
- Database design (using SQL, NoSQL)
- Introductory programming (Java, C#, HTML/CSS)
- AP Computer Science
- Back-end programming (JSON API design)

## Rates
* * *
Here are my competitive rates, per subject, for *online* lessons:

- Math and Science: **$30/hr**
- Computer Science:
  * Database design: **$35/hr**
  * Introductory programming: **$30/hr**
  * AP Computer Science: **$35/hr**
  * Back-end programming: **$35/hr**

In-person lessons will cost **+$10/hr** due to costs and time associated with
transportation. My schedule is also significantly less flexible with regards to
in-person lessons.

I typically recommend 1 hour long lessons, as longer lessons can be fatiguing.
Of course, I am glad to do longer lessons, but my schedule may be less flexible
with regards to this.

*I have two different systems for paying for lessons:*

### Packages
Lessons packages are designed for your convenience, so you can pay for lessons in
advance (either weekly or monthly). They are designed on a case-by-case basis,
depending how many lessons you'd like your child to have weekly, and how long
these lessons will be.

I offer a discount of **$5/hr** for any package that is more than 1 hour of lessons
weekly.

For example, if you'd like to have 3 hours of math tutoring per week, you can
pay $105 weekly, or $420 monthly.

### Per Lesson
Alternatively, you can choose to pay per lesson.

When starting off, I generally recommend this as it allows us to make sure that
your child and I work well together, and that future lessons will be effective.

<a name="policies">

## Policies
* * *
I have a few important policies that you should take note of:

1. Please notify me of cancellations at least *24 hours* in advance. Cancellations
*within* 24 hours forfeit **50%** of the lesson fee. If you do not notify me or a class
is skipped, or the lesson is part of a package, **100%** of the lesson fee will
be forfeited. Obviously, family or medical emergencies are an exception to this policy.
2. Please contact me only via email, SMS, or phone call, as I use Skype exclusively
for lessons and will not check it otherwise.
3. Payment is accepted in 5 different ways:
    * **PayPal** (to friends and family, to avoid unnecessary fees)
    * **Venmo**
    * **Cash** (only for in-person lessons)
    * **Check** (only for in-person lessons)
    * **Cryptocurrency** (not very convenient, so I recommend other options)

4. I typically assign *10-30 minutes of homework* for every hour of tutoring.
If you would prefer I not assign homework, please let me know.

*Q:* I'd like for you to tutor a certain subject, but you haven't listed it.
Can you tutor this subject?

*A:* Please send me an email in this case. I'll likely say yes :)

*Q:* Do you tutor on weekends?

*A:* Yes! Usually in the morning and early-mid afternoons.

*Q:* Your prices are too high. How do I know I'll get what I pay for?
