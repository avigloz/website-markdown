# Tutoring
[\[Home\]](../) [\[About me\]](../about.html)

I currently offer tutoring services in various subjects. I do most of my tutoring
online (over Skype), though I have done in-person tutoring in the past on
numerous occasions.

I have taken various math courses (up to Calculus 3), as well as several
Computer Science related courses. I also work on programming during much of my
spare time, and work on various projects.

I've also taken numerous English courses, and have written several Wikipedia articles,
meaning I am fairly adept at doing research and composing long-form papers/essays.

## Rates
* * *
Here are my competitive rates, per subject, for *online* lessons:

- Math and Science: **$40/hr**
- Computer Science:
  * Database design: **$40/hr**
  * Introductory programming: **$35/hr**
  * AP Computer Science: **$40/hr**
  * Back-end programming: **$40/hr**
- English: **$25/hr**

In-person lessons will cost **+$10/hr** due to costs and time associated with
transportation. My schedule is also significantly less flexible with regards to
in-person lessons.

I typically recommend 1 hour long lessons, as longer lessons can be fatiguing.
Of course, I am glad to do longer lessons, but my schedule may be less flexible
with regards to this.

*I have two different systems for paying for lessons:*

### Packages
Lessons packages are designed for your convenience, so you can pay for lessons in
advance (either weekly or monthly). They are designed on a case-by-case basis,
depending how many lessons you'd like your child to have weekly, and how long
these lessons will be.

I offer a discount of **$5/hr** for any package that is more than 1 hour of lessons
weekly.

For example, if you'd like to have 3 hours of math tutoring per week, you can
pay $105 weekly, or $420 monthly.

### Per Lesson
Alternatively, you can choose to pay per lesson.

When starting off, I generally recommend this as it allows us to make sure that
your child and I work well together, and that future lessons will be effective.

## Policies
* * *
I have a few important policies that you should take note of:

1. Please notify me of cancellations at least *24 hours* in advance. Cancellations
*within* 24 hours forfeit **50%** of the lesson fee. If you do not notify me or a class
is skipped, or the lesson is part of a package, **100%** of the lesson fee will
be forfeited. Obviously, family or medical emergencies are an exception to this policy.
2. Please contact me only via email, SMS, or phone call, as I use Skype exclusively
for lessons and will not check it otherwise.
3. Payment is accepted in 5 different ways:
    * **PayPal** (to friends and family, to avoid unnecessary fees)
    * **Venmo**
    * **Cryptocurrency** (not very convenient, so I recommend the other two options)
    * **Cash** (only for in-person lessons)
    * **Check** (only for in-person lessons)

4. I typically assign *10-30 minutes of homework* for every hour of tutoring.
If you would prefer I not assign homework, please let me know.
