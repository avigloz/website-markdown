## General introduction
* * *
As you may already know, my name is *Avi Glozman*. I recently graduated high
school in June of 2018. In fall 2018, I will join the class of 2021 at the
University of Pittsburgh as a CS major. I participated in the Running Start
program during high school, from fall 2016 to spring 2018.

Since 2012-2013, I've been working on various personal [projects](projects/index.html) and otherwise
developing my knowledge of computer science and technologies. Currently, I'm
working on RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, Docker, SQL/NoSQL, etc.

My focus is currently to finish personal projects that I've already started, and
to start making APIs that provide real-time data visualization.
