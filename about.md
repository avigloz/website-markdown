### General introduction
* * *
As you may already know, my name is *Avi Glozman*. I'm currently a student at
Bellevue College in Bellevue, WA as part of the Running Start program.
In fall 2018, I will join the class of 2022 at the University of Pittsburgh as
a CS major.

Since 2012-2013, I've been working on various personal [projects](/projects.html) and otherwise
developing my knowledge of computer science and technologies. Currently, I'm
working on RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, Docker, SQL/NoSQL, etc.

Here's a [photo](/ref-photo.jpg) of me, so you can recognize me if we meet in-person.
