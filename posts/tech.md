## Software

### Web

<blockquote>
- Firefox (Developer Edition)
  - **Extensions**
    - [Amazon Smiley](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazon-smiley/)
      - Redirects you to Amazon Smile, which makes Amazon donate to charity once you buy stuff.
    - [Bypass Paywalls](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bypass-paywalls-firefox/)
      - Paywalls on news sites are annoying; this does a good job of bypassing them.
    - [CanvasBlocker](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/)
      - Helps protect you against fingerprinting.
    - [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/)
      - The best dark theme extension available, I use it on nearly every site (including this one!).
    - [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)
      - Helps protect you against tracking.
    - [Distract Me Not](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/distract-me-not/?src=external-github-download)
      - Stops me from going to timesink websites during work.
    - [Dormancy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dormancy/)
      - Unload unused tabs, thus freeing resources allocated to them.
    - [Honey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/honey/) (I turn this on as needed)
      - Occasional discounts on random sites, useful if I don't already have a discount of some kind.
    - [Old Reddit Redirect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-reddit-redirect/)
      - Redirects you to the *old.reddit.com* version of a reddit.com page.
    - [Textarea Tabbing](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/textarea-tabbing/)
      - Makes it so you don't move from a textbox to the "Submit" button by accident when you hit the *Tab* key (especially useful in online code editors).
    - [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
      - Perhaps the most important extension I have installed.
- Chromium (*not Google Chrome!*)
  - I use only uBlock with Chromium. I hardly use the browser, so I keep it lightweight.
  - I almost exclusively use this for Google Meet.
</blockquote>

**Notes:**

I mainly (99% of the time) use Firefox because it's by far the most usable, well-designed web browser. Also, it's open source!\ 
That said, some sites annoyingly do not fully support it (notably Instacart, Google Meet, etc.)

### Media

<blockquote>
- **Music**
  - [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/home/)
    - It's cross-platform, reliable, has a fantastic catalog, and great discovery features.
- **Video**
  - [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/)
    - The best video player, period. Also has other useful features like ability to convert between formats, etc.
- **Images**
  - *On Linux*, I use [Viewnior](https://siyanpanayotov.com/project/viewnior). 
    - Super lightweight and fast.
  - *On Windows*, I use [IrfanView](https://www.irfanview.com/). 
    - Super lightweight and fast, and the logo is adorable!
</blockquote>

### Office software
<blockquote>
- **Writing/Slideshows/Spreadsheets**
  - I use almost exclusively the following software for these purposes:
    - [LibreOffice Suite](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
    - Google Docs, Slides, Sheets
  - I do not use related Microsoft products - for me, there is no reason to.
- **Email**
  - I typically do not use a dedicated email client, but occasionally I may use [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/). 
    - It's a fantastic, underrated piece of software.
- **PDF**
  - *On Linux*, I use [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/). 
    - Lightweight and fast.
  - *On Windows*, I usually use [Adobe Acrobat](https://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/). 
    - [Foxit PDF Reader](https://www.foxit.com/downloads/#Foxit-Reader/) is a viable alternative.
</blockquote>

### Development tools
<blockquote>
- **Editor**
  - [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). 
    - It's almost entirely identical to VSCode, just better. Zero reason not to use it.
- **Terminal emulator**
  - [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
    - GPU-accelerated and reliable.
