Here are some "posts" I've written. They are not written for the express
purpose of being published here, but I post them here anyway.

I mostly write short stories, however poetry or long-form papers/essays may also appear here every so often.

## Short stories

<blockquote>
 - ***["A Peaceful Dream"](peacefuldream.html)*** - 12/08/18
 - ***["Vastest Ocean"](vastestocean.html)*** - 03/25/19

## Poetry

(nothing here yet)

## Random thoughts, things, ideas, and opinions

<a href="./music">Music collection and thoughts on music</a>

I am a [synesthete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), which in my case means that I may interpret/visualize certain sounds and tastes as shapes or curves.\
For example, the taste of marzipan looks like a hook-shaped curve.

### Opinions
<blockquote>
- **Computer stuff**
	- Mainstream Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Mint are beyond sufficient for every-day use by the majority of people.
	- For software engineering, using Linux or MacOS offers a far superior experience in most use-cases, and allows for far more efficient workflows with less bloat.	
	- For normal use, thumb trackball mice are a superior pointing device (although I'll always be partial to Lenovo's TrackPoint). For videogames, I still use a "regular" mouse.
- **General tech stuff**
	- Firefox is the best browser currently available.
	- 6+ inch screens on phones are way too big, and I'm not sure why making them is the meta.
- **Misc**
	- Utz "Extra Dark" pretzels are fantastic, and grossly underrated.
	- Orangutans, cats, and owls are cool.
	- Potatoes are good in any form (except raw), especially in a samosa.
