Here are some "posts" and other things I've written. They are typically not written with the express
purpose of being published here, but I may post them here anyway.

I mostly write short stories, however poetry or long-form papers/essays may also appear here every so often.

## Short stories

<blockquote>
 - ***["A Peaceful Dream"](peacefuldream.html)*** - 12/08/18
 - ***["Vastest Ocean"](vastestocean.html)*** - 03/25/19

## Poetry

(nothing here yet)

## Random thoughts, things, ideas, and opinions

<a href="./music">Music collection and thoughts on music</a>

I am a [synesthete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), which in my case means that I may interpret/visualize certain sounds and tastes as shapes or curves.\
For example, the taste of marzipan looks like a hook-shaped curve.

### Opinions
<blockquote>
- **Computers and programming**
	- Mainstream **Linux** distributions like Ubuntu and Linux Mint are *beyond sufficient for every-day use by the majority of people*. It is a shame that there is a lack of OEM adoption.
	- Split keyboards (such as the ErgoDox) and thumb-trackballs (such as the Logitech M570) are extremely good.
	- **Firefox** is the best web browser currently available (on both desktop and mobile).
- **General technology**
	- 6+ inch screens on smartphones *are way too big*, and I'm not sure why making them is the meta. 
	- Electric cars and solar energy are the future.
	- **[AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem)** is a problem that *should be more widely discussed and considered*.
- **Food**
    - Salmon is the tastiest fish (especially raw with sushi rice), while tilapia is the most versatile.
	- Steak is best eaten rare (or somewhere inbetween blue and rare), and dry-aged 30-60 days.
    - Utz "Extra Dark" pretzels are fantastic, and grossly underrated.
	- Potatoes are good in any form (except raw), *especially in a samosa or "french fried."*
	- Mass production of animal food products, in conjuction with massive food-related waste, *will have catastrophic consequences* (i.e climate change, cross-species viruses, etc.) if not mitigated. These industries do not scale well.
	- "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day" is propoganda. Instead, have a cup of water, coffee, and a granola bar.
- **Uncategorized**
    - Intermittent fasting and exercise are the most reliable methods for weight loss (especially when combined).
	- Music and film are the *most impressive human art forms.*
	- Minecraft is one of the best videogames ever made.
	- **Orangutans**, cats, and owls are very cool animals.
