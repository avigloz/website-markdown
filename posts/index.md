Here are some "posts" and other things I've written. They are typically not written with the express
purpose of being published here, but I may post them here anyway.

I mostly write short stories, however poetry or long-form papers/essays may also appear here every so often.

## Short stories

## Random thoughts, things, ideas, and opinions

[Music collection and thoughts on music](./music)

[Software and technology I like (and why)](./tech)

I am a [synesthete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), which in my case means that I may interpret/visualize certain sounds and tastes as shapes or curves.\
For example, the taste of marzipan looks like a hook-shaped curve.

Here's one of my favorite mathematical theorems: [Infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem). Here's some [monkey writing](../docs/NOTES_EN.pdf)!\
If you're bored, here's a [library of random text](https://libraryofbabel.info/) (related to the above theorem).

### Opinions
<blockquote>
- **Computers and programming**
	- Mainstream **Linux** distributions like Ubuntu and Linux Mint are *beyond sufficient for every-day use by the majority of people*. It is a shame that there is a lack of OEM adoption.
	- **Firefox** is the best web browser currently available (on both desktop and mobile).
- **General technology**
	- Split keyboards (such as the ErgoDox) and thumb-trackballs (such as the Logitech M570) are extremely good.
	- 6+ inch screens on smartphones *are way too big*, and I'm not sure why making (or wanting) them is the meta.
	- Cryptocurrency, as it is used by most people, is simply a hip way to gamble (*for now*).
		- Oddly, this manner of existing has pushed it into the spotlight, and is now allowing it to grow out of that mold very fast.
	- Electric cars, renewable energy, and biodiesel are the future (of transporation and energy).
	- **[AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem)** is a problem that *should be more widely discussed and considered*.
- **Food**
    - Salmon is the tastiest fish (especially raw with sushi rice), while cod is the most versatile.
	- Steak is best eaten **rare** (or somewhere inbetween blue and rare), dry-aged 30-60 days, as a ribeye or picanha, with chimichurri.
    - Utz "Extra Dark" pretzels are fantastic, and grossly underrated.
	- Potatoes are good in any form (except raw), *especially in a samosa or "french fried."*
	- Mass production of animal food products, in conjuction with massive food-related waste, *will have catastrophic consequences* (i.e climate change, cross-species viruses, etc.) if not mitigated. These industries do not scale well.
	- The concepts of "3 meals a day" and "breakfast is most important" are social constructs. Eat when you're hungry, not when you "should."
		- Some people eat [once a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_SNIwW6iX8)!
	- Nobody should eat modern cereals. They're too refined, processed, and morbidly sweet.
	- I don't know why people still drink non-"diet" soda. *Drinking ~40g of sugar in one serving, sometimes multiple times per day, is suicidal.*
		- If you do this, here's my advice (**don't** take this with a grain of salt): **try your best to stop, it will save you from a plethora of health problems.**
		- In general, carbonated drinks containing acids aren't good, so if you want a healthy alternative to soda, try flavored seltzer.
		- Added note: *Coca-Cola and friends couldn't care less if you live or die*, and have even refused to lower sugar content (despite threats of increased taxation).
- **Uncategorized**
    - Intermittent fasting and exercise are the most reliable methods for weight loss (especially when combined).
	- Music and film are the *most impressive human art forms.*
	- Minecraft is one of the best videogames ever made.
	- **Orangutans**, cats, and owls are very cool animals.
