# Tutoring
[Home](../)
[About me](../info/about)
[Posts](../posts/)

I offer tutoring services to families and individual students in any North American timezone.\
*I am now offering both online tutoring, **and** in-person tutoring for students who are fully vaccinated in Manhattan (Uptown) and Queens (west of Corona Park)*

I can accomodate at most two students in parallel per month. **_Currently BOTH slots are open!_**

### Subjects and rates
<blockquote>
- **Computer Science/Programming** - **$55/hr (65 minutes)**
  - **Topics such as:** *general programming, algorithms, Linux, web services, JavaScript, networking, databases/architecture, or anything else you see on my résumé.*
  - **Qualification**: I am an experienced, full-time software engineer specializing in backend engineering at a fast-growing startup.
- I have previously tutored subjects such as reading/writing, and math, however am no longer offering these subjects. Sorry about that!

### Discounted rates
If you choose to buy lessons as a lesson package (**recommended**), I offer the following package discounts:

<blockquote>
- **4-lesson package** (one lesson per week): *$20 off* total package cost
- **8-lesson package** (two lessons per week): *One lesson is free!*
</blockquote>

Only packages of 4 or 8 lessons are available, and you can only pay for additional lesson packages after the 4th or 8th lesson (respectively).\

### Payment and important info
I accept payment via PayPal, Venmo, cash, or check (latter two for in-person lessons **only**).

- For packages, payment is to be received in advance, at least 24 hours before the first lesson.
- For individual lessons, payment can be made at the beginning of a lesson or any time before.
- Time/money spent traveling to an in-person lesson will be reflected in the lesson price. For example, if it takes me 30 minutes to get to a lesson, an additional fee of $27.50 will be added *per lesson.*
- If you feel that a lesson went poorly, or you would like to stop lessons entirely, I offer the following refund policy:
  - If it is an individual lesson, *50% of will be refunded (not including travel costs)*.
  - If you are seeking a refund for a lesson package, *only remaining lessons will be refunded*.
- Normally, I will email students with relevant homework/reading after each lesson. It serves as useful lesson review and preparation for the next lesson.\
*If you'd like to opt out of this, please let me know.*

If you're interested in lessons, or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at: **avi [@t] avigloz [d.ot] net**\
Please include an appropriate subject line to ensure I read your message (such as *"Computer science lessons for my daughter"*).

### Fees and notices
<blockquote>
- Any cancellations within 24 hours of a lesson forfeit 25% of the lesson fee, except in serious circumstances. Please take care to cancel as soon as possible, as that will ensure you get your money back.
- No-notice absenteeism (more than 20 minutes late or no-show, with no warning) forfeits 100% of the lesson fee. I will not begin a lesson more than 20 minutes after its scheduled time.
- I reserve the right to cancel individual lessons as needed, or stop giving lessons entirely. Full (prorated) refunds will be issued.
