# Tutoring

[About me](../info/about.html)
[Posts](../posts/index.html)

I offer tutoring services to families and individual students in any North American timezone.
I do tutoring <i>online</i> only, over any preferred (and mainstream) video-chat service. After the pandemic passes, I will resume in-person tutoring in the NYC/JC area.

If you'd like to inquire about tutoring or have questions about rate discounts, please reach out to me via email.

### Subjects I teach

<blockquote>
- Computer Science/Programming *(applied, theoretical)*
- Math *(anything before Calculus)*
- English/Writing/Research *(any level)*
</blockquote>

For university students, all rates are <u>$20 USD /hr</u>.
Otherwise, rates are as follows (respectively):

- $50 USD /hr
- $30 USD /hr
- $30 USD /hr

I accept payment via PayPal or Venmo.

**Note:** Unless you are a very close friend or we have a previous agreement, I will not provide any services for free. Sorry.
