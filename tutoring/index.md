# Tutoring
[Home](../)
[About me](../info/about)
[Posts](../posts/)

I offer tutoring services to families and individual students in any North American timezone.\
I do tutoring <i>online</i> only, over any preferred (and mainstream) video-chat service.

*Beginning August 2021, I will begin to offer in-person tutoring for students who are fully vaccinated in the Brooklyn, NY area.*

### Subjects and rates
<blockquote>
- *Computer Science/Programming* - **$55/hr (65 minutes)**
  - Topics such as: *web services, JavaScript, personal website creation, networking, or anything you see on my résumé.*
  - I am an experienced full-time software engineer specializing in backend engineering.
- *English/Writing/Research* - **$40/hr (65 minutes)**
  - My SAT R/W score was 730/800, with a Reading score of 34/40, and a Writing score of 39/40 (99th percentile overall)
  - I've published and contributed to over a dozen live Wikipedia articles, in addition to the works that can be found on this website.

Normally, I will email you with relevant homework/reading after each lesson. It serves as useful lesson review and preparation for the next lesson.\
*If you'd like to opt out of this, please let me know before the first lesson.*

### Discounted rates
If you choose to buy lessons as a lesson package (**recommended**), I offer the following package discounts:

<blockquote>
- **Computer Science**
	- 4-lesson package (one lesson per week): *$20 off* total package cost
- **English**
	- 4-lesson package (one lesson per week): *$15 off* total package cost
- **Any 8 lesson package**
	- *One lesson is free!*
</blockquote>

Only packages of 4 or 8 lessons are available, and you can only pay for additional lesson packages after the 4th or 8th lesson (respectively).\

### Payment and important info
I accept payment via PayPal, Venmo, cash, or check (latter two for in-person lessons **only**).

- For packages, payment is to be received in advance, at least 24 hours before the first lesson.
- For individual lessons, payment can be made at the beginning of a lesson or any time before.
- If you are not satisfied with your *first lesson*, you may ask for a refund afterwards.
	- If this lesson is part of a package, only remaining lessons will be refunded.

Right now, I am working with at most two students per month. **_Currently ONE slot is open!_**

If you're interested in lessons, or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at: **contact [@tt] avigloz [d..ot] net**\
Please include an appropriate subject line to ensure I see your message (such as *"Computer science lessons for my daughter"*)

### Fees and notices
<blockquote>
- Any cancellations within 24 hours of a lesson forfeit 25% of the lesson fee, except in serious circumstances. Please take care to cancel as soon as possible, as that will ensure you get your money back.
- No-notice absenteeism (more than 20 minutes late or no-show) forfeits 100% of the lesson fee. Tutoring will stop after the second instance, and remaining lessons in a package will be refunded.
- If assigned homework is not completed consistently, there will be no fee, but I will stop sending it.
- I reserve the right to cancel individual lessons as needed, or stop giving lessons entirely. Full refunds will be issued.
