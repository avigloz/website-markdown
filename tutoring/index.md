# Tutoring
[Home](../)
[About me](../info/about)
[Posts](../posts/)

I offer tutoring services to families and individual students in any North American timezone.\
I do tutoring <i>online</i> only, over any preferred (and mainstream) video-chat service.

*Beginning August 2021, I will begin to offer in-person tutoring for students who are fully vaccinated in the Brooklyn, NY area.*

### Subjects and rates
<blockquote>
- *Computer Science/Programming* - **$55/hr (65 minutes)**
  - Topics such as: *web services, JavaScript, personal website creation, networking, or anything you see on my résumé.*
  - I am an experienced full-time software engineer specializing in backend engineering.
- *English/Writing/Research* - **$40/hr (65 minutes)**
  - My SAT R/W score was 730/800, with a Reading score of 34/40, and a Writing score of 39/40 (99th percentile overall)
  - I've published and contributed to over a dozen live Wikipedia articles, in addition to the works that can be found on this website.
</blockquote>

### Discounted rates
If you schedule multiple lessons at once, you'll get a 12.5% discount off *of the total for that set of lessons.*\
**Example**: Two one-hour Computer Science lessons per week, for 1 month.

<blockquote> 
- If you pay for each lesson individually, you would pay $440.
- If you pay for all 8 lessons in advance, you would pay $385 (one lesson is *free*).
</blockquote>

### Payment and important info
I accept payment via PayPal, Venmo, cash, or check (latter two for in-person lessons **only**).

- *All payment is to be made in advance, regardless of lesson quantity.* 
- If you are not satisfied with your *first lesson*, you may ask for a full refund.

Right now, I am focusing on at most 2 students at a time. **_Currently ONE slot is open!_**

If you're interested in lessons, or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at: **contact [@tt] avigloz [d..ot] net**\
Please include an appropriate subject line to ensure I see your message (such as *"Computer science lessons for my daughter"*)

### Fees
<blockquote>
- Any cancellations within 24 hours of a lesson forfeit 25% of the lesson fee, except in serious circumstances. Please take care to cancel as soon as possible, as that will ensure you get your money back.
- No-notice absenteeism (more than 20 minutes late or no-show) forfeits 100% of the lesson fee. Tutoring will stop after the second instance.
