# Tutoring

[Home](../)
[About me](../info/about)
[Posts](../posts/)

I offer tutoring services to families and individual students in any North American timezone.

I do tutoring <i>online</i> only, over any preferred (and mainstream) video-chat service.\
*Beginning August 2021, I will begin to offer in-person tutoring for students who are fully vaccinated in the Brooklyn, NY area.*

### Subjects and rates

<blockquote>
- *Computer Science/Programming* - **$55/hr**
  - Topics such as: *web services, JavaScript, personal website creation, networking, or anything you see on my résumé.*
  - I am an experienced full-time software engineer specializing in backend engineering.
- *English/Writing/Research* - **$40/hr**
  - My SAT R/W score was 730/800, with a Reading score of 34/40, and a Writing score of 39/40 (99th percentile overall)
  - I've published and contributed to over a dozen live Wikipedia articles, in addition to the works that can be found on this website.
</blockquote>

- If you schedule multiple lessons at once, you'll get a 10% discount off *of the total for that set of lessons.*
  - Example: Two one-hour Computer Science lessons per week, for 1 month
    <blockquote>
    - If you pay for each lesson individually, you would pay $400.
    - If you pay for all 8 lessons in advance, you would pay $360.
    </blockquote>

I accept payment via PayPal, Venmo, cash, or check (latter two for in-person lessons **only**).

As of assuming full-time employment, I regrettably have much less time for tutoring.\
I will tutor at most 2 students at a time. **_Currently ONE slot is open!_**

If you're interested in lessons, or have questions about rate discounts, please don't hesitate to reach out to me [via email](../info/about).

### Fees:
- Any cancellations within 24 hours of a lesson forfeit 25% of the lesson fee, except in serious circumstances.
- Absenteeism forfeits 50% of the lesson fee. Tutoring will stop after the second instance.
  - Note that if you pay in advanced, 100% of the lesson fee will be forfeit. It is to your detriment to skip lessons - but especially those that are purchased in advance.
