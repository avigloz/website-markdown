# Tutoring

I offer tutoring services to families and fellow students.
I do tutoring <i>online</i> only, over any preferred (and mainstream) video-chat service.

If you'd like to inquire about tutoring or have questions about rate discounts, please reach out to me via email.

### Subjects I teach


>- Computer Science/Programming *(applied, theoretical)*
>- Math *(anything before Calculus)*
>- English/Writing/Research *(any level)*

For fellow students, all rates are <u>$20 USD /hr</u>.
Otherwise, 

My speciality is Computer Science, thus I charge the most for it.

**Note:** Unless you are a very close friend or we have a previous agreement, I will not provide any services for free. Sorry.
