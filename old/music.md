# Music I listen to
[\[Home\]](/)

I listen to a variety of music, spanning a variety of genres and artists. On
average, I spend 1-3 hours of my day listening to music. I often have music on
in the background as well, as it helps me focus and is simply enjoyable.

I also enjoy sharing music with people, and will often do so if conversation
reaches a topic of music, or if directly asked to recommend songs.

That said, consider this page one big recommendation of music :)

If you want to see *all* the music in my collection, check out [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/aviglozman/playlist/1EQw7BQ7GDoqYc9AJumTjB?si=JAB-gk1uT4KIRXsqgQL_Tw).
You will need Spotify to listen to it; there are 800+ songs in this playlist.

## Music for certain activities
* * *
In general, I'd say that I listen to relatively similar music when I'm by
myself. However, in some cases I will curate the music I'm listening to to fit
the mood, setting, or an activity I am participating in.

Here are a few examples:

### Driving

- If my mood is good, I'll listen to more upbeat/fast/high-volume music
  such as **hip-hop, KPOP, rock, metal, or electronic.**
- If my mood is pensive, sad, or I'm in a state of thought, I will listen
  to slower and/or sadder **rock** (90% of the time).
- If I'm driving with other people, I may adjust music that is
  playing to account for their preferences as well.
  * With *friends* it's usually: **hip-hop**, **KRNB**, **pop**, or random music
    for enjoyment and amusement.
  * With *girlfriend* it's usually: any music we both enjoy, or music I'd like to
    recommend.
  * With *parents* it's usually: music that is familiar to them, or that is
    similar to what I'd expect them to like.

### Eating

- In *restaurants*, I often prefer to hear upbeat music as that contributes to
  a fun atmosphere (especially when out with friends).
- In *public places*, such as parks or cafeterias, I will typically listen to my
  own music (using earbuds). If with friends, or in a good mood and/or in open
  air, I may use a portable speaker for music instead.
- At *home*, I typically do not listen to music while eating (unless I am eating
  while working).

### Exercise

- I will *almost always* listen to music while exercising, unless it is a very
  mobile sport like soccer, frisbee, badminton, or swimming (which would pose
  its own set of issues anyway).

### Talking

- While talking to others, I will not listen to music unless it is playing in
  the background. Occasionally, if the song playing is good, I may point it out
  during conversation.
- If talking using VoIP (over the internet), I will often play music in the
  background at a lower volume than that of incoming speech.
