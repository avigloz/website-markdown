# Photo repository
[\[Home\]](../index.html)

Links on this page take you to relevant directory views. They contain most photos
that I like to have uploaded in original quality, not compressed by online
photo storage providers (e.g Google Photos).

This section of the site is not linked anywhere else, which means that you either
found it using some hacky magic (brute force), or I gave you the link.
Either way, enjoy.
