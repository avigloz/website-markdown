## General introduction
* * *
As you may already know, my name is *Avi Glozman*. I recently graduated high
school in June of 2018. As of Fall 2018, I am part of the Class of 2021 at
the University of Pittsburgh.

I participated in the Running Start program during high school,
from fall 2016 to spring 2018.

Since 2012-2013, I've been working on various personal [projects](projects/index.html) and otherwise
developing my knowledge of computer science and technologies. Currently, I'm
working on developing my knowledge of data science, and focusing on
learning the Julia programming language as a tool for future learning and
development.

In the past, my projects have focused exclusively on writing RESTful JSON APIs
for various purposes, and I hope to be able to incorporate this knowledge and
experience into my future work.
