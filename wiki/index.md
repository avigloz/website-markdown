# Index (Wikipedia)
[\[Home\]](/) [\[Table of contents\]](/toc.html)

This is the index for the Wikipedia-related posts. This section is fairly
straight-forward, and as a result will not serve as a table of contents like
other indexes on this site. This is subject to change, but will remain as
the status quo for the foreseeable future.

## Motivations behind editing
* * *
Initially, I began editing as part of [Vipul Naik's](#external) [Sponsored Wikipedia Editing project](#external).
Essentially, I would be paid varied sums of money to research and write Wikipedia
articles on various topics (from scratch). A list of articles I wrote can be
found below.

As of March 2017, I no longer accept payment for writing on Wikipedia. Instead,
I simply edit voluntarily (whether that be updating my previous work, or making
small/miscellaneous edits on various pages).

If you'd like to see how much I was paid, and for which edits I was paid, check
[this](#external) out.

If you'd like to see a list of my contributions, see [this](#external).

My userpage on Wikipedia can be found [here](#external).
