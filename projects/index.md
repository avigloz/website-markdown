This is the index for the project-related posts. It's like a table of contents,
but more specific. Each item has a short summary attached.

**Please note that the majority of the pages listed here are under
construction, and may not be functional.**

## Personal projects
* * *

The following projects were made on my own, with little-to-no help from anyone
else. That said, these maybe more focused on specific technologies, and most
likely less impressive than projects I've worked on with other people.

<a name="site">

### [About this site](site.html)
This page discusses various aspects of this website, ranging from how it was
made to inspirations behind its design. It also includes a rough history of
my website in general, and other possibly interesting things.

<a name="linkr">

### [linkr](linkr.html)
Linkr is an open-source link shortener written as a RESTful API in Node.js
with Express.

<a name="phantom">

### [phantom](phantom.html)
Phantom is a web application that creates disappearing web pages. The original
idea came from the desire to emulate a "dead-drop" system, where data
disappears after being accessed once by anyone.

<a name="rslash">

### [rslash](rslash.html)
rslash or "r/" is a Google Chrome extension designed to make browsing to
subreddits on the social news aggregation platform Reddit faster.

## Team Projects
* * *
The following projects were made (as the name of the section suggests) with a
team. Primarily, these projects were made with Owen Cheung and Terrance Li, with
the team name *team phoenyx*.

<a name="musica">

### [Musica](musica.html)
Musica is an Android app which allows for crowd-sourced music selection during
parties or events. Essentially, this means that the users of the app get to vote
on which songs are to be played next on the host's phone.

<a name="sail">

### [Sail](sail.html)
Sail is an Android app that helps users keep track of their commitments,
including **goals** and **promises**, while simultaneously tracking completed
commitments as **achievements** and adding them to an interactive timeline.

<a name="tapstreak">

### [Tapstreak](tapstreak.html)
Tapstreak is an Android app that in essence is a clone of Snapchat, but with a
very noticable twist. Unlike Snapchat, there is no capability to message or send
photos within the app, as streaks of interactions are instead tracked by
"**tapping**."
