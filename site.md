## Technologies
* * *
In making this site, I'm using a specific set of technologies and tools. I've
organized them below:

### Hosting
- Azure (Ubuntu VM)
- nginx
- TLS (certified by [Let's Encyrpt](#external))

### Web development
- Markdown
- Pandoc (to build .md (markdown) files into HTML pages)
- I use a script to build all the files at once, so I don't have to do it
individually. I do run some builds individually when I'm working on only one
file.

### Editing
- I use Atom (text editor) to write everything. I may transition to VS Code in
the near future, but I like Atom's look/feel and it's customizability.

## Thoughts
* * *
I decided to change the format of my website to something more readable, and
easier to navigate. I totally get that CSS and JS are useful for making stuff
look pretty, but I'm not a web designer seeking to show off my skills. My goal
for this site is to document various things, while also making these things
easily accessible with a design that focuses on organization.

You may find the formatting on this site reminiscent of the wiki format, which
it is indeed inspired by. It is also inspired by Issa Rice's [website](#external).

## History
* * *
The previous version of this site was designed by my friend [Owen Cheung](https://github.com/owenhcheung), who did a great job.
Said version can be found [here](https://github.com/avigloz/website/).
At some point in the future I may host it on a subdomain.
