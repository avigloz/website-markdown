As you may already know, my name is Avi! Here I am:

Here's some tid-bits about me:

<blockquote>
- As of 2021, I am 21 years old.
- I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in December 2020 (Bachelor of Science, Computer Science), 2.33 years after graduating from high school.
- I am an immigrant, originally from Israel.
- I speak English and Russian fluently, and have varying mastery of other languages (Hebrew, Spanish, etc).
- I enjoy writing, and regularly write poetry or short stories (typically unshared, though there are some [here](../posts/index.html)).
- I'm passionate about learning, and spend a couple hours per day either reading/contributing to Wikipedia, consuming other well-sourced informational work on various subjects, or engaging in experimentation/tinkering.

## Goals and plans

Currently, **I'm working as a Backend Engineer for a startup called [Hooked, Inc.<svg width="14px" height="14px" viewBox="0 -5 25 25"><use href="#external-link"></use></svg>](https://hookedstream.com)**

My personal goals (achievable within the next 5 years) are as follows:

1. Learn about business, and establish a local non-profit for laptop re-use and repurposing.
	- Newer versions of Windows are too much for older (or lower-spec) machines. Linux is a great way to bring these laptops back to life.
	- I'd like to empower people who do not have the resources to use on laptops for work or school, by offering a free laptop for anyone who needs it.
2. Repay my student loans (~$110,000!), which I will very likely fully refinance and repay by June 2024 (at the absolute latest).
	- If you're curious as to how I am approaching this, I'd be happy to offer insight.
3. Invest in real estate, travel, start my own online business, etc.

## Projects

Most of my meaningful work is stored publically on [my GitHub<svg width="14px" height="14px" viewBox="0 -5 25 25"><use href="#external-link"></use></svg>](https://github.com/avigloz). Browse to your heart's content! Of course, I have private repositories, too! ;)
