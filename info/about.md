As you may already know, my name is Avi! Here I am:

<img src="../images/avi_photo_summer2020.png" alt="A photograph of Avi Glozman" height="375px" width="375px"/>

Here's some tid-bits about me:

- I will be graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in December 2020 (Bachelor of Science, Computer Science), 2.33 years after graduating from high school.
- I am an immigrant, originally from Israel.
- I speak English and Russian fluently, and have varying mastery of other languages.
- I enjoy writing, and regularly write poetry or short stories (typically unshared, though there are some [here](../posts/index.html)).
- I'm passionate about learning, and spend a couple hours per day either reading/contributing to Wikipedia, or consuming other well-sourced informational content.

## Goals and plans

Currently, **I'm looking for a full-time software engineering role to start in Q1 2021**. However, due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, my priorities are flexible. 

Upon graduating, and relocating to the NYC area, I plan on pursuing the following goals:

1. Work towards completing, and eventually complete a working MVP of **rentnexus** (see below),
2. Learn about business, and establish a local non-profit for laptop re-use and repurposing.
	- Newer versions of Windows are too much for older (or lower-spec) machines. Linux is a great way to bring these laptops back to life, and also introduce people to *free* (as in freedom, but also cost) alternatives to proprietary, bloated and slow ways to use their computers.
	- I'd like to empower people who do not have the resources to use on laptops for work or school, by offering a free laptop for anyone who needs it.
3. Begin paying off my student loans, which I hope to fully pay off by 2024 (at the latest).

## Projects

These projects are projects I have worked on or am working on during my time in university.

- [rentnexus](https://rentnexus.net): A student-sourced subletting and renting listings platform for use by universities.
- [Synesthesia](https://github.com/avigloz/synesthesia): A program that creates interesting visual representations of audio files, written entirely in C++.

I have other projects through [my GitHub](https://github.com/avigloz).
